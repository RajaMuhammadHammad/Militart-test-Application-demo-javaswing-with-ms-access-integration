* UCanAccess JDBC Driver *(for modern systems, as JDBC-ODBC bridge is deprecated)*

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/RajaMuhammadHammad/Militart-test-Application-demo-javaswing-with-ms-access-integration.git`

2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans or IntelliJ).

3. Ensure MS Access `.mdb` or `.accdb` file is in the correct path.

4. Configure JDBC connection string in code:
